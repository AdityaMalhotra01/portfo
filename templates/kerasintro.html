        <p>Keras is an API designed for human beings, not machines. Keras follows best practices for reducing cognitive load: it offers consistent & simple APIs, it minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases, and it provides clear & actionable error messages. It also has extensive documentation and developer guides.</p>

        <p>Keras is the most used deep learning framework among top-5 winning teams on Kaggle. Because Keras makes it easier to run new experiments, it empowers you to try more ideas than your competition, faster. And this is how you win.Built on top of TensorFlow 2.0, Keras is an industry-strength framework that can scale to large clusters of GPUs or an entire TPU pod. It's not only possible; it's easy.</p>
        <p>Take advantage of the full deployment capabilities of the TensorFlow platform. You can export Keras models to JavaScript to run directly in the browser, to TF Lite to run on iOS, Android, and embedded devices. It's also easy to serve Keras models as via a web API.</p>

        <p>Keras is used by CERN, NASA, NIH, and many more scientific organizations around the world (and yes, Keras is used at the LHC). Keras has the low-level flexibility to implement arbitrary research ideas while offering optional high-level convenience features to speed up experimentation cycles. Because of its ease-of-use and focus on user experience, Keras is the deep learning solution of choice for many university courses. It is widely recommended as one of the best ways to learn deep learning.</p>

        <h3>Features</h3>
        <p>Keras contains numerous implementations of commonly used neural-network building blocks such as layers, objectives, activation functions, optimizers, and a host of tools to make working with image and text data easier to simplify the coding necessary for writing deep neural network code. The code is hosted on GitHub, and community support forums include the GitHub issues page, and a Slack channel.</p>

          <P>In addition to standard neural networks, Keras has support for convolutional and recurrent neural networks. It supports other common utility layers like dropout, batch normalization, and pooling.[11]</P>
          
         <p>Keras allows users to productize deep models on smartphones (iOS and Android), on the web, or on the Java Virtual Machine.[3] It also allows use of distributed training of deep-learning models on clusters of Graphics processing units (GPU) and tensor processing units (TPU) principally in conjunction with CUDA.[12]</p>
